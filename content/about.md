# About Modulove

Modulove is an open-source project dedicated to creating accessible, DIY-friendly firmware for Eurorack modular synthesizers.

## Philosophy

We believe in:

- **Open Source**: All our firmware is freely available and open for modification
- **Community Driven**: Built by modular enthusiasts, for modular enthusiasts
- **Accessible DIY**: Making modular synthesis accessible to everyone
- **Innovation**: Pushing the boundaries of what's possible with simple hardware

## Our Modules

Our modules are based on affordable, widely-available components like the Arduino Nano, making them perfect for DIY builders of all skill levels.

### A-RYTH-MATIK

Based on the excellent Hagiwo design, our A-RYTH-MATIK firmware collection offers multiple approaches to rhythm generation:

- Euclidean algorithms for mathematical perfection
- Generative patterns for organic evolution
- Classic sequencing for hands-on control
- Experimental modes for sonic exploration

## Technology

Our firmware leverages:

- **Arduino Platform**: Accessible, well-documented, and widely supported
- **Web-Based Flashing**: No software installation required
- **Multiple Board Support**: Works with standard Arduino Nano and old bootloader variants
- **Modular Code**: Built on libModulove for easy extension and modification
